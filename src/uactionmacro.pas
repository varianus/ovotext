  The TActionMacroEvent class was taken from the uSynAPI.pas file in the syn
  project (see http://syn.sourceforge.net/). The only changes made is to
  create a separate unit for the class and the addition of constructor and
  destructor methods as well as the ActionLists property.

  How it works:

    The TSynMacroRecorder works by recording events and keeping them in an
    array. It records all text editting functionailty, but does not record
    external events like searching/replacing, and so on.

    However, since each event in the array is actually a separate object,
    you can add custom events to the recorder by inheriting from the base
    TSynMacroEvent class and implementing new event recording functionality.

    This class (TActionMacroEvent) is one such class and is designed for the
    recording of action list events and their subsequent playback. It works by
    hooking onto the action list's OnExecute function and creating a new
    TActionMacroEvent object and adding it to the recorder's event list.

    By storing the Action List's name and providing to the TActionMacroEvent
    class the list of all possible actions, the object is able to locate the
    recorded action and re-execute it on playback.

  How to use this class:

    1) Include a TSynMacroRecorder in your project and add a method to the
       OnStateChange event. Add the following StateChange function to your form.

       This code assumes your form class is TfrmMain, the name of the
       TSynMacroRecorder instance is SynMR, and you have 4 action lists
       (alEdit, alFile, alFormat and alSearch).

          procedure TfrmMain.SynMRStateChange(Sender: TObject);
          begin
            if SynMR.State = msRecording then
            begin
              alEdit.OnExecute:= pRecordActions;
              alFile.OnExecute:= pRecordActions;
              alFormat.OnExecute:= pRecordActions;
              alSearch.OnExecute:= pRecordActions;
            end
            else if Assigned(alEdit.OnExecute) then
            begin
              alEdit.OnExecute:= nil;
              alFile.OnExecute:= nil;
              alFormat.OnExecute:= nil;
              alSearch.OnExecute:= nil;
            end;
          end;

    2) Add the InExecute variable and pRecordActions procedure to your form:

        var
          InExecute: Boolean;

        procedure TfrmMain.pRecordActions(Action: TBasicAction; var Handled: Boolean);
        var
          AEvent: TActionMacroEvent;
        begin
          if not InExecute and (Action <> actRecord) and (Action <> actPlay) then
            with SynMR do
            begin
              AEvent:= TActionMacroEvent.Create;
              AEvent.ActionName:= Action.Name;
              AEvent.ActionLists.Add(alEdit);
              AEvent.ActionLists.Add(alFile);
              AEvent.ActionLists.Add(alFormat);
              AEvent.ActionLists.Add(alSearch);
              AddCustomEvent(TSynMacroEvent(AEvent));
              InExecute:= True;
              try
                Action.Execute;
                Handled:= True;
              finally
                InExecute:= False;
              end;
            end;
        end;

    3) Done!
